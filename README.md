## Instructions

### Model Dimensions

Begin by defining the overall dimensions of the wrench. The length, width, and thickness of the wrench can vary depending on your design requirements. Ensure that these dimensions are accurate.

### Extrusion

Use the "Extrude" command to create the main body of the wrench. Draw a 2D profile of the wrench head (usually hexagonal or open-ended) and use the "Extrude" command to give it depth. The length of the extrusion will determine the thickness of the wrench head.

### Adding Openings

Create openings for the wrench, such as the openings for nuts and bolts, using the "Subtract" or "Intersect" command to remove the material from the wrench head.

### Handle Design

Create the handle of the wrench. This can be cylindrical or a different shape based on your design. Ensure it is ergonomic and comfortable to grip.

### Texturing and Detailing

Add texture, chamfers, fillets, and other details to make the wrench more realistic and functional. Use the "Chamfer" and "Fillet" commands for rounding edges and corners.

### Adding Markings

If necessary, you can add markings or labels to indicate the wrench's size, brand, or other information.

### Hole for Hanging

If your wrench design includes a hole for hanging storage, create a cylindrical hole at the end of the handle using the "Hole" or "Extrude" command.

### Materials and Colors

Assign materials and colors to the various parts of the wrench to make it visually appealing. You can use the "Materials" and "Render" features in AutoCAD for this purpose.

### Final Check

Before saving your 3D model, double-check all dimensions, clearances, and details to ensure that it accurately represents a functional mechanical wrench.

### Saving and Exporting

Save your 3D wrench model in a suitable file format, such as DWG or STL, for further use in AutoCAD or for 3D printing or rendering in other software.
